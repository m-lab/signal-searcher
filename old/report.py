"""Problem descriptions and the compilation of Problems into Reports.

This module has two classes of interest to exporters: Problem and Report. Each
Problem is a specific instance of a performance problem observed in the
specified data, and each Report is a compilation of many problems.  The
Problems are in charge of keeping track of their own descriptions, and the
Report is in charge of prioritization of Problems to make the overall
explanation make sense.

Every individual test for problems should likely implement their own subclass
of report.Problem, but it is unlikely that an individual test for a problem
would need to implement its own Report.
