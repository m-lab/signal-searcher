"""Look for evidence of performance fluctuating on a 24-hour cycle.

This module looks for evidence of daily periodicity in a timeseries. When a
network has performance that varies diurnally, then that is a strong suggestion
that the network is near overload, as network usage varies diurnally for most
eyeball networks.  In the MLab report on interconnections, it was found that
performance varying on a 24-hour basis was a leading indicator of severe
congestion problems.
